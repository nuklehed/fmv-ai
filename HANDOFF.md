# Handoff — FMV App Project

## What was done
1. **Grilled the user on `project_plan.md`** — resolved all domain concepts through a grill-with-docs session
2. **Created `CONTEXT.md`** — comprehensive domain glossary with 16+ entries (HCP, Assessment, Criteria Set, Audit Trail, etc.)
3. **Created 3 ADRs in `docs/adr/`:**
   - `0001-assessments-as-discrete-events.md` — Assessments are discrete events, not HCP record updates
   - `0002-async-single-worker-ai-processing.md` — Async queue, single worker, local LLM
   - `0003-logical-multi-tenancy.md` — tenant_id on every record
4. **Published 10 tracer-bullet issues to GitHub** (nuklehed/fmv-ai) with agent briefs and triage labels
5. **Completed Issue #1 — Foundation setup:**
   - Monorepo structure: `apps/frontend/`, `apps/backend/`, `packages/shared/`

    - All code committed and pushed to main branch
16. **Completed Issue #16 — Draft assessments actionable from list view & detail panel:**

18. **Completed Issue #20 — Consolidate settings nav links into Settings control center:**
    - Frontend: `/settings` renders SettingsView directly (notification settings for all users)
    - Frontend: `/settings/control-center` renders SettingsControlCenterView with sidebar layout (Admin/SA only)

    - Frontend: Reactive `ref<number>` variables (`approvalValidityPeriod`, `expiryReminderLeadTime`) bound to v-model
    - Populated from API response in fetchSettings; handleSave reads directly from them
    - All code committed and pushed to main branch

## Key domain decisions to remember
- HCPs are master identity records; Assessments are discrete evaluation events
- Assessment lifecycle: DRAFT → SUBMITTED → AI_PROCESSING → AI_COMPLETE → UNDER_REVIEW → APPROVED/REJECTED/EXPIRED
- Criteria sets can be shared across specialties (e.g., prescriber vs non-prescriber)
- Tier locked to score; rate overrideable with mandatory rationale
- Single-worker async AI processing against local LLM (qwen2.5:32b via Ollama)
- Logical multi-tenancy via `tenant_id` on every record
- Notifications: in-app + email by default, active for all users

## Session notes — 2026-06-05 (architecture deepening)
### Completed refactors
| # | What | Commit |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Collapsed `routes/assessments.ts` (~700 lines) → `domain/assessment.ts` (9-method domain module, routes now ~240 lines thin adapters) | `0666649` |
| 2 | Split monolithic AI worker into `promptBuilder.ts`, `llmClient.ts`, `responseParser.ts` + thin orchestrator | `a61ee0c` |
| 3 | Extracted assessment lifecycle from two frontend views (~1100 lines) → `frontend/src/domain/assessment.ts` (shared helpers + 15 API ops) | `63268a2` |

### Bug fixes in this session
- **Frontend domain module missing auth headers** — all 15+ fetch() calls were unauthenticated. Added `authHeaders()` helper that reads `accessToken` from localStorage and attaches Bearer token.
- **FormData upload corrupted by JSON Content-Type** — `authHeaders()` was injecting `'Content-Type': 'application/json'` into every request, breaking the multipart boundary on CV uploads. Created separate `authHeadersFormData()` for file uploads (no Content-Type header, lets browser set boundary).
- **Backend `.env` pointed at production DB** — `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` were still pointing at `diskstation.local:5430` / `6379`. Changed to `localhost:5432` / `6379` for local Docker.

### Session notes — 2026-06-05 (UX improvements)
#### Completed
| # | What |
|---|------|
| 1 | **Issue #24 — Submission feedback UX**: Replaced inline success message with prominent blue gradient banner on assessment submission. Shows "Assessment Submitted for AI Evaluation" header, processing time explanation, and live countdown timer (4s). User is redirected to `/assessments` where the list auto-refreshes every 30s showing `AI_PROCESSING` status with spinner animation. The existing "Submitting..." loading state on the button during API call remains unchanged. |
| 2 | **Issue #24 follow-up — Submission error handling**: Fixed three bugs in submission flow:
   - Error messages now render inside the submission banner (not hidden in a small form field)
   - Non-DRAFT assessments are blocked from editing with a clear warning + redirect
   - LLM model reference updated to `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` across `.env.example` and `llmClient.ts`
| 3 | **Issue #24 follow-up — Post-AI workflow**: After AI completes (`AI_COMPLETE`), Admin/SA opens the detail panel to review, override answers, and approve/reject with tier/rate overrides. The list auto-refreshes every 30s while processing.

#### Known issues
- **Git repository corruption** — some older commit trees are missing (`aa8961f`, `c7402fd`, etc.). Current HEAD and recent commits work fine, but `git status`/`git add` fail with "unable to read tree" errors. Workaround: use plumbing commands (`git hash-object`, `git mktree`, `git commit-tree`) or do a fresh clone if needed. |



#### Newly discovered issues (2026-06-06)
| # | GitHub Issue | Description |
|---|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | ~~[#25](https://github.com/nuklehed/fmv-ai/issues/25)~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** (`1b1b58e`) - Added AI_FAILED red badge + "AI Failed" label, `isFailed()`/`canRetry()` helpers, retry button in list view (BU for own, Admin/SA for any), and error reason display in detail panel with Ollama guidance |
| 2 | ~~[#26](https://github.com/nuklehed/fmv-ai/issues/26)~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** (`ba919b7` + `4f1da09` + `f90fdce`) - Added ⚠️ Action Required badge, Needs Review filter, AND dedicated `/assessments/:id/review` page with two-phase workflow:
   - Phase 1: Read-only AI results display
   - Start Review → transitions AI_COMPLETE → UNDER_REVIEW
   - Phase 2: Editable answer dropdowns (with rationale when different from AI), live score counter, tier/rate selection, approve button
   - Nav improvement: Clicking the Action Required badge OR any AI_COMPLETE row navigates directly to `/assessments/:id/review` (reduced from 3 clicks → 1 click)
| 3 | ~~[#27](https://github.com/nuklehed/fmv-ai/issues/27)~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** (`78288f9`) - Added `GET /api/llm/health` endpoint (checks Ollama + model loaded status), pre-flight check in frontend before submission, clear error messages with actionable guidance (e.g., "ollama pull qwen3.6-35b-a3b") |
| 4 | **AI_FAILED retry UX improvement** (`ef39b4a`) — When retry fails due to unparsable LLM output:
   - Backend worker now stores raw LLM output snippet (first 300 chars) in aiResults as `_diagnostic` entry
   - Frontend detail panel shows parsed error messages instead of raw JSON
   - Added "Show diagnostic info" toggle to view raw LLM output for debugging
   - Added retry button directly in detail panel footer (no need to go back to list)
| 5 | **LLM response parsing fix** (`152cf6a`) — Model was returning wrong field names:
   - `question` instead of `questionId`, `selected_answer` instead of `selectedAnswerId`
   - Answer IDs wrapped in brackets: `[a2]` instead of `a2`
   - Fixed responseParser to handle these aliases + strip bracket wrappers
   - Strengthened prompt with explicit WRONG examples showing the exact pattern to avoid |
| 6 | **LLM positional ID fallback** (`bc64ebc`) — Model now uses completely different format `{"q1": "a2"}`:
   - Added `tryMatchPositionalId()` in responseParser: handles q1, a2, q1a2 patterns → maps to real DB UUIDs
   - Three-tier fallback: exact match → positional matching → reject
   - Strengthened system prompt with explicit 36-char UUID examples and "DO NOT" section
   - Changed user prompt format from `[${answer.id}]` to `ID: ${answer.id} | Score: ...` to avoid bracket confusion |

### Current blockers (user-side)
- **Docker Desktop** — needs to be running for PostgreSQL + Redis containers. Once up:
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d          # start postgres + redis
  npm run db:seed               # create default users (sa@fmv.local / admin123, etc.)
  npm run dev                   # start backend + frontend
  ```
- **Port conflicts** — old node processes can linger. If ports are in use:
  ```bash
  netstat -ano | findstr :3001   # find PID on port 3001
  taskkill //PID <pid> //F       # kill it
  ```

## Suggested skills to invoke next
- **triage** — to label issues as ready for AFK agents once published
- **to-prd** — if a formal PRD is needed before implementation starts
